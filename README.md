# Introduction
This Python function calculates the structural similarity (SSIM) index for grayscale or color images. The index range from -1 to +1, closer to +1 indicates the high similarity to the reference image, -1 informs the highest dissimilarity.

# Quick Pipeline Visualization
Example: Fused images with keypoints
| SSIM value | SSIM map image|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.9407032 |   |

# Requirements
